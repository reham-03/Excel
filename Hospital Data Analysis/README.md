Hospital Records Analysis 

Project Overview

This project analyzes hospital mortality rates, death growth, and patient outcomes using Excel for data cleaning, processing, and dashboard creation. The goal is to track monthly deaths, cumulative data, growth rates, and dead versus live statistics to aid in medical and administrative decision-making.

Problem Statement

Hospitals often collect data on patient outcomes, but without proper analysis, it can be hard to identify patterns in mortality rates or track the effectiveness of medical treatments over time. The raw data requires transformation into actionable insights.

Solution

I created an Excel dashboard that cleans, organizes, and visualizes patient outcome data, with a focus on death rates and growth trends. The dashboard offers clear insights into total deaths, death growth rates, month-to-month changes, and risk categories.

Objectives

• Analyze hospital death rates and trends

• Track the percentage of total deaths versus live outcomes

• Calculate the death growth rate by month

• Monitor high and low-risk patients

• Evaluate cumulative deaths per month

Key Insights & Results

Overall Performance

• Total Outcomes: 403 patients

• Total Deaths: 69 patients

• Total Live Patients: 334 patients

• Death Rate: 17.1%

Death Trends

• Highest percentage of deaths: September (29%)

• Lowest percentage of deaths: December (5%)

Growth Trends

• Death growth peaked in July with a 125% increase

• Deaths decreased sharply in December (-80%)

Cumulative Dead

• The cumulative dead count has risen steadily over the months, reaching 69 by December

Risk Category Insights

• High-risk category patients contribute to 54.84% of the total deaths

• Low-risk category patients make up 45.16%

Change in Mortality Rates

• Significant changes were observed in July (+5 deaths) and August (-4 deaths), indicating varying levels of mortality during those months

Conclusion

The Excel dashboard provides crucial insights into the hospital’s mortality trends, highlighting patterns in deaths, growth rates, and the effects of high vs. low-risk patient categories. This information is vital for improving patient care strategies, resource allocation, and monitoring healthcare effectiveness.
