Costa Cafe – Sales & Orders Dashboard

Project Overview

This project analyzes sales performance and customer behavior for Costa Cafe using Excel for data cleaning, processing, and dashboard creation.
The goal is to understand sales trends, popular items, peak order times, and overall customer behavior to support better business decisions.

Problem Statement

Small cafés often have raw sales data but struggle to convert it into meaningful insights. Without visual analysis, it becomes difficult to identify top-selling items, busiest days, or shifts with the highest demand.

Solution

I designed a complete Excel dashboard that cleans, organizes, and visualizes the cafe’s sales data.
The dashboard provides clear insights into item popularity, order volume by day and month, payment method trends, and operational performance.

Objectives
 • Analyze café sales and order volume
 
 • Identify the most popular coffee items
 
 • Understand customer payment preferences
 
 • Track monthly and daily order patterns
 
 • Evaluate performance by work shift (morning, afternoon, evening)
